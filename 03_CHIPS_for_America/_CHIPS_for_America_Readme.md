<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

The files in this repository allow for replication of the figures in the May 2022 memo entitled ["Economic Impacts of the CHIPS for America Act."](https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/USICA_Semiconductors.pdf) 

In this memo, we made use of the Data for Progress Jobs Model to conduct a macroeconomic analysis of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) for America Act, which was enacted by Congress in January 2021 and which would have been funded through several emergency appropriations provisions of the United States Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which passed the Senate by a vote of 68-32 in June 2021 but was never reconciled with its companion bill in the House. However, much of this funding was ultimately included in the CHIPS and Science Act signed by President Biden in August 2022.

Key findings from our analysis were that the emergency CHIPS Act appropriations in USICA would have contributed around $60 billion per year to U.S. GDP from 2022 through 2026, and would have created or preserved a total of around 2.8 million jobs over the same period.

<!-- Overview of Repository -->
## Overview of Repository

The repository contains the following four folders:

### Directory Structure

1. **Data** - raw inputs needed to run model code;
2. **Output** - files containing final results shown in memo;
3. **Programs** - Stata code needed to compute model results; 
4. **Work** - intermediate results saved in the course of running the model code;


### Replicating Results

To replicate the results in the memo, run the program called **Run_CHIPS_for_America_Model.do**, which is located in the **Programs** folder. Be sure to change the working directory at the top of the code to reflect your own filepaths.
<br /> <br />
The comments in this program describe the model implementation in greater detail, but after running it the final results will be saved in the **Output** folder. In particular:

- **CHIPS_for_America_Spending_by_Fiscal_Year.dta** contains total CHIPS Act spending appropriated by USICA for each year from 2022 to 2026, as reported in Table 1/Figure 1 on pg. 5 of the memo;
- **CHIPS_for_America_Model_Run_Final_Results.dta** contains estimated aggregate employment effects as reported in Table 2/Figure 2 on pg. 5 of the memo, as well as estimated aggregate effects on value added/GDP as reported in Table 3/Figure 3 on pg. 7;
- **CHIPS_for_America_Model_Run_Final_Results_by_State.dta** contains estimates of direct, indirect, induced, and total employment effects by state over the period 2022 to 2026, as reported in Table 4 pg. 9.
